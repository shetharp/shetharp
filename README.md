### 🎈 I am a startup-savvy engineer building technology for a more creative future. 

I currently build products to help WeWork design and sell beautiful spaces around the world.
I'm a battle-tested starter, having co-founded Crater, a synthetic media startup, and hustled at Matter, a manufacturing startup backed by Techstars. 
I hold an M.Eng in CS from Cornell Tech and did my undergrad at Cornell University.
