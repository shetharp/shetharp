### 🎈 I am a startup-savvy engineer building technology for a more creative future. 

I currently develop software at WeWork that empowers interior designers and architects to design beautiful spaces at unprecedented scale. Previously, I co-founded Crater, a synthetic media startup, and was early at Matter, a manufacturing startup backed by Techstars. I hold an M.Eng in CS from Cornell Tech and did my undergrad at Cornell University.
